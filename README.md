  LagrangePolynom. This program creates lagrange polynom. Input data: int variable 'a' is a value that i insert in obtained polynom for checking that everything is 'ok', variable 'n' is a count of nodes for polynom construction, then vectors of X and Y. Output data: coefficients of obtained polynom and a value of interpolated function in the point 'a'. I have two functions. In function formPart i create a monom, then in function formPolynom i make polynom by summing up monoms.  
  Komponent. This proagram calculates a count of coherence component for any simple graph. Input data: count of vertices. Output data: count of components.
